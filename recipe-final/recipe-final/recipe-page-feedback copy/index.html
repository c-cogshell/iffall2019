	<div> <p>My font size is a bit too small for a such a thin type choice as well. The word “cookies” in my title is larger than the other part of my title, which doesn’t create good hierarchy and  it highlights the wrong part title. Having the brown box on top of the picture is possibly a little chaotic, since the title blends into the picture. Another student read my total time and severing information wrong so I will try to clearly  separate them. There were small things they helped me see like Making sure my capitalization and alignments  was consistent. Other good points they brought up was to add a picture at the bottom because you can’t see the picture at the top and to break up the steps. They also wanted me to explore different color options but i think my minimal design was to focus on the information and create a clean experience since cooking can be stressful.</p></div>
