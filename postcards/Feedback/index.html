	<div> <h1><p<>1st version</p></h1>
<p>I think the photos could have a vignette or floor fade to be even clearer and continue the old hollywood vibe you have.</p>

<p>- I can see how easily this would fade in and out between desktop and mobile so I would be a great path to follow.</p>
<p>- I didn’t notice the drop shadow so darken that would help.</p></div>

<div> <h1><p>2nd version</p></h1>
<p>also really nice!  the photo needs more contrast, there are no bright white highlights to match the white text.</p>
<p>- I wonder why the top line of text is bigger in the desktop version but not the mobile version its just a small inconstancy. </p>
<p>- I think the quotes that pin the to bottom are more successful than the 2nd version. But  i know its not possible to pin this Qoute to the bottom, if you change the type to san serif it will match with the rest even with different placement. </p></div>

<div><h1><p>3rd verison</p></h1>
<p>-  The first and third version are very similar in font choice but the subtle drop shadow was really nice touch that could be brought into your first version.</p></div>

<div><h1><p>consideration:</p></h1>
<p>possibly add in color to bring more pop to the routes but I understand that doesn’t match the b&w film vibe your doing.</p></div>
