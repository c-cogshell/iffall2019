	<p><h2>Designer:</h2> Camryn Cogshell <h2>Creative Director:</h2> Lauren Jin</p>
	<p><h2>Notes:</h2> Over all I tried to keep the design simple and easy to understand through the labling of the sections. I think sections like "propgration" and "uses" could have better placement. I didnt notice this till I brought the images into the web browerser. I Think the problem might be type size. Also I would like to hear your opinion on use of colour. I think more colour could be used to break up the section but the examples you gave were more minimal. </p>
		<p>(in the actual version I would take out all the foonotes ofc)</p></div>
