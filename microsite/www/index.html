				<h1>What is a Mangosteen?</h1>
				<h4>Mangosteen <i>(Garcinia mangostana)</i>, also known as the purple mangosteen, is a tropical evergreen tree with edible fruit native to Island Southeast Asia.
				</p></h4>
				</div>	
				<div class="column2">
				<h2>Location?</h2>
				<p>Its exact origins are unknown due to its widespread cultivation since ancient times, but it is believed to have been somewhere between the Sunda Islands and the Moluccas. It grows mainly in Southeast Asia, southwest India and other tropical areas such as Colombia, Puerto Rico and Florida, where the tree has been introduced.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="column2">
				<h2>Taste?</h2>
				<p>The fruit of the mangosteen is sweet and tangy, juicy, somewhat fibrous, with fluid-filled vesicles (like the flesh of citrus fruits), with an inedible, deep reddish-purple colored rind when ripe. In each fruit, the fragrant edible flesh that surrounds each seed is botanically endocarp, i.e., the inner layer of the ovary. Seeds are almond-shaped and -sized.</p>

		<h3>Propagation and Harvest</h3>
		<div class="column4">
			<h4>Mangosteen is usually propagated by seedlings. <b>Vegetative propagation*</b> is difficult and seedlings are more robust and reach fruiting earlier than vegetative propagated plants.</h4>
			<p> As seed formation involves no sexual fertilization, the seedling is genetically identical to the mother plant. If allowed to dry, a seed dies quickly, but if soaked, seed germination takes between 14 and 21 days when the plant can be kept in a nursery for about 2 years growing in a small pot.</p>
			<p>When the trees are approximately 10–12 in, they are transplanted to the field at a spacing of 66–131 ft. After planting, the field is mulched in order to control weeds. Transplanting takes place in the rainy season because young trees are likely to be damaged by drought.Because young trees need shade,intercropping* with banana, plantain, rambutan, durian or coconut leaves is effective. </p>
			<p>* any form of asexual reproduction occurring in plants in which a new plant grows from a fragment of the parent plant or a specialized reproductive structure.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="column8">
			<h2>Condtions?</h2>
			<p>Mangosteen trees have a weak root system and prefer deep, well drained soils with high moisture content, often growing on riverbanks. The mangosteen is not adapted to limestone soils, sandy, alluvial soils or sandy soils with low organic matter content. Mangosteen trees need a well distributed rainfall over the year (<40 mm/month) and a 3–5 week dry season. Mangosteen trees are sensitive to water availability and application of fertilizer input which is increased with the age of trees, regardless of region. Maturation of mangosteen fruits takes 5–6 months, with harvest occurring when the pericarps are purple</p>
			
		</div>

		<div class="column8">
			<h2>Yeild?</h2>
			<p>Mangosteen trees may reach fruit-bearing in as little as 5–6 years, but more typically require 8–10 years. The yield of the mangosteen is variable, depending on climate and age of the tree.If the young tree is bearing for the first time, 200–300 fruits may be produced, whereas at maturity, 500 fruits per season are average. At age 30 to 45 years in full maturity, each tree may yield as many as 3,000 fruits, with trees as old as 100 years still producing.</p>

				<h3>Tree and Fruit</h3>
				<p>A tropical tree, the mangosteen must be grown in consistently warm conditions, as exposure to temperatures below 32 °F for prolonged periods will usually kill a mature plant. They are known to recover from brief cold spells rather well, often with damage only to young growth. Experienced horticulturists have grown this species outdoors, and brought them to fruit in extreme south Florida.</p>
				<p>The juvenile mangosteen fruit, which does not require fertilisation to form (see agamospermy), first appears as pale green or almost white in the shade of the canopy. As the fruit enlarges over the next two to three months, the exocarp colour deepens to darker green. During this period, the fruit increases in size until its exocarp is 6–8 centimetres (2.4–3.1 in) in outside diameter, remaining hard until a final, abrupt ripening stage.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="column1">
				<p> <h1> How Does it get its Color?</h1> Once the developing mangosteen fruit has stopped expanding, chlorophyll synthesis slows as the next colour phase begins. Initially streaked with red, the exocarp pigmentation transitions from green to red to dark purple, indicating a final ripening stage. This entire process takes place over a period of ten days as the edible quality of the fruit peaks. Over the days following removal from the tree, the exocarp hardens to an extent depending upon post-harvest handling and ambient storage conditions, especially relative humidity levels. If the ambient humidity is high, exocarp hardening may take a week or longer when the flesh quality is peaking and excellent for consumption. However, after several additional days of storage, especially if unrefrigerated, the flesh inside the fruit might spoil without any obvious external indications. Using the hardness of the rind as an indicator of freshness for the first two weeks following harvest is therefore unreliable because the rind does not accurately reveal the interior condition of the flesh. If the exocarp is soft and yielding as it is when ripe and fresh from the tree, the fruit is usually good.The fruit is often described as a subtle delicacy, the flesh bears an exceptionally mild aroma, quantitatively having about 1/400th of the chemical constituents of fragrant fruits, explaining its relative mildness.</p>

				<H1>Cooking</H1>
				<p>Before ripening, the mangosteen shell is fibrous and firm, but becomes soft and easy to pry open when the fruit ripens. To open a mangosteen, the shell can be scored with a knife, pried gently along the score with the thumbs until it cracks, and then pulled apart to reveal the fruit. Alternatively, the mangosteen can be opened without a knife by squeezing the shell from the bottom until it breaks, allowing the shell to be removed and the fruit eaten while intact with the stem. Occasionally, during peeling of ripe fruits, the purple exocarp juice may stain skin or fabric. In Vietnam, the ripe fruit is also used as a salad ingredient.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="column9">
				<H1>Natural Dye</H1>
					<p>he extract of mangosteen peels are traditionally used in Indonesia as the source of natural dye for textile colouring; to acquire brown, dark brown, purple to red hues, especially applied in traditional tenun ikat and batik textile</p>
			</div>
				
			<div class="column9">
				<H1>Traditional Medicine</H1>
					<p>various parts of the plant have a history of use in traditional medicine, mostly in Southeast Asia; it may have been used to treat skin infections, wounds, dysentery, urinary tract infections, and gastrointestinal complaints, although there is no high-quality clinical evidence for any of these effects</p>
